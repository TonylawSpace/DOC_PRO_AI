What is a prenuptial agreement?
A prenuptial agreement is a written contract between the two parties before marriage regarding their rights and obligations in marriage. According to the Civil Code, as long as the agreed content does not violate public order and good customs and is signed voluntarily with consensus, it is legally binding. This marriage contract can effectively prevent suspicion and disputes, making life after marriage smoother and more secure.

What are the common contents of a prenuptial agreement?

Prenuptial agreements cover a wide range of areas, among which the following four are the most common:

1. Agreement on the property system of the couple after marriage

Both parties agree to agree on a separate property system, that is, each party owns and manages their own property after marriage.

2. The registered nominee for real estate transactions
If you plan to purchase real estate after marriage, both parties can agree on the ownership in advance to avoid disputes in the future. For example, if a couple buys a house together, they can agree on whose name the house will be transferred and registered.

3. Agreement on discretionary funds
A prenuptial agreement can stipulate how living expenses will be allocated after marriage, including pocket money given by one party to the other, or how household expenses will be allocated. It is recommended that full-time housewives or househusbands can advocate "housework paid system" in the agreement to transform housework into calculable remuneration and fight for their due protection.

4. Agreement on post-marital life
Both parties can also make some basic regulations for post-marital life, such as:
Surname issue: whether to take the husband's surname or the wife's surname, and whether the future children should take the father's surname or the mother's surname.
Residence arrangement: whether to live with the parents-in-law or choose to live on your own.
Distribution of household chores: how to share household chores, the proportion of mutual assistance between the two parties, etc.

How to write a prenuptial agreement to make it effective?
As long as both parties agree on the content of the prenuptial agreement and sign it in writing, it will be legally effective. It is worth noting that the agreement cannot involve divorce conditions or changes in status, otherwise the part will be considered invalid. The following are some invalid examples:
Affecting changes in status
If the prenuptial agreement involves changes in status, such as "as long as the other party has domestic violence, the custody of the child will belong to me", such an agreement is not recognized by the law.

Divorce conditions
For example, "divorce if the other party has an affair" or "divorce if you can't have children", such content with divorce as a condition is invalid.

Does the prenuptial agreement need to be notarized?
The validity of a prenuptial agreement does not depend on whether it has been notarized. As long as both parties voluntarily sign it in person, the content of the agreement is legally binding. The significance of notarization is only to provide additional protection to avoid the invalidation of some contents due to violation of public order and good customs.
